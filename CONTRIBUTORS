# UNVM Contributors

Currently, UNVM is maintained and developed solely by:

**Felix Schreiber [GitHub: Scriptor25]**

All code contributions, issue handling, and releases are performed by the sole maintainer.

## Contribution Process

Since this is a solo-maintained project:

1. All code changes are reviewed and tested by the maintainer before merging.
2. Any new feature, bug fix, or update is committed directly by the maintainer.
3. Users are welcome to suggest improvements via GitHub Issues or pull requests, but these must:
   - Be tested by the contributor, **or**
   - Include a working proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrating functionality.
4. Contributions will be reviewed and merged at the discretion of the maintainer.
